##  First CSE326 - LPU Project 


<p> I had made a website on Saloon management system by using HTML & CSS with basic JavaScript in which a user can 
 sign in/sign up and can even book appointments. Users can also check rate list of the various services provided 
 and gallery of saloon infrastructure.
